switch:-
The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

This is how it works:

The switch expression is evaluated once.
The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
If there is no match, the default code block is executed.

switch
The switch statement evaluates an expression, matching the expression's value against a series of case clauses, 
and executes statements after the first case clause with a matching value, until a break statement is encountered. 
The default clause of a switch statement will be jumped to if no case matches the expression's value.


switch with expression
const marks = 78;

switch (true) { //78===true

   case marks>=90: console.log("you are one of the toppers");
    break;
    case marks>=75: console.log("you have scored distinction ");
    break;
  case marks>=40: console.log("pass with grace"); 
   break;0
  
 
  default: console.log("bhaii to to gaya! fail hai tu!!!!");

}

simple switch 
const expr = 'Papayas';
switch ('Papayas') {
  case 'Oranges':
    console.log('Oranges are $0.59 a pound.');
    break;
  case 'Mangoes':
  case 'Papayas':
    console.log('Mangoes and papayas are $2.79 a pound.');
    // expected output: "Mangoes and papayas are $2.79 a pound."
    break;
  default:
    console.log(`Sorry, we are out of ${expr}.`);
}

const number = 97

switch (number){//97
  case  100: console.log("sky is blue")
   break;
    case  80: console.log("sky is white")
   break;
    case 97: console.log("sky is pink")
   break;
    case 82: console.log("sky is black")
   break;
    default : console.log("sunny day")
}

const expre = ""

switch (expre){
  case  'Mattress' : console.log("Mattress is beautiful & colorfull")
   break;
    case  'bedsheet': console.log("bedsheet is white")
   break;
    case 'curtain': console.log("curtain is beautiful & colorfull")
   break;
    case 'dress': console.log("dress is beautiful & colorfull")
   break;
    default : console.log(" All the furnitures are beautiful & colorfull")
}

const color = ""

switch (color){
  case  'red' : console.log("we are in danger")
   break;
    case  'black': console.log("blackout")
   break;
    case 'green': console.log("we are good to go")
   break;
 
    default : console.log(" no signal, we have to take a pause")
