React uses the virtual DOM as a strategy to compute minimal DOM operations when re-rendering the UI. 
It is not in rivalry with or faster than the DOM! The virtual DOM provides a mechanism that abstracts
manual DOM manipulations away from the developer, helping us write more predictable code.


What is DOM and virtual DOM in React?

VDOM is the virtual representation of Real DOM. React update the state changes in Virtual DOM first 
and then it syncs with Real DOM. Virtual DOM is just like a blueprint of a machine, can do the changes
 in the blueprint but those changes will not directly apply to the machine.
